## 2D
- [KinematicBody2D](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/physics/godot3_kinematic2d/) - In this lesson, we will look at the KinematicBody2D node and show some examples of how it can be used.
- [RigidBody2D](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/physics/godot3_kyn_rigidbody1/) - RigidBody2D is the physics body in Godot that provides simulated physics. This means that you don’t control a RigidBody2D directly. Instead you apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.) and Godot’s built-in physics engine calculates the resulting movement, including collisions, bouncing, rotating, etc.
